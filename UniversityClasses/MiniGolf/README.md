# MiniGolf

MiniGolf is a basic mini gol game, which I made as third [task](./Lista03.pdf) for University course *Making games in Unity3D game engine*.

***The game has a bug which occurs on finnishing last level (it's impossible to put your score to scoreboard). I had no time to fix it, even if it is simple bug***

***Even if you decide to play this game, I strongly suggest to turn down the game sounds in options menu. The music is very annoying in this game to my view.***

## Instalation

* You can find instalation instructions in [here](Unity/README.md)

* Unity version: *2019.2.10f1*

## Instructions

* Game has 9 levels, each completed when you hit the ball to hole

* Your final score is total amount of shots you needed to complete all levels *(the fewer the better)*.

* To shoot ball, you need to press right mouse button, and then holding the button still, you have to slide mouse in opposite direction you want to shot, and then release the mouse button. The further you slide mouse, the stronger shot will be.

* Dragging will only work, when you click on the field *(if you press background, it will not start dragging)*.

* You can cancel drag if you press right moue button while dragging

* Use middle mouse button to rotate camera around the ball

* When you are dragging your shot, you will have indicator from ball, which shows power and the direction of the shot.

* Your shot dragging will only work, if the mouse is on the field. When you will get the mouse away from field, you will be informed about it, by the red light which will show in the upper left corrner, and your dragging will stop untill you get the mouse back on the field. If you are aming correctly, the light in upper left corner will be green.

* Click right cross in upper right corner during game, to exit to main menu.
