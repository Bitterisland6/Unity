# Tutorial

This is the first task for our University course *Making games in Unity3D game engine*.
We had to go through [this](https://youtu.be/pCBqgREiSUE) tutorial.
**This project is so simple, that I decided to make build only for Linux. It wasn't valuable to make build for Windows and macOS.**

## Instalation

* You can find instalation instructions in [here](https://github.com/Bitterisland6/Unity/blob/master/README.md) in *Running the project* section.

* Unity version: *2019.2.10f1*

## Instructions

* Use `arrows` to move

* Use `Space` to restart

* There is no special goal in this game
