# voxLand

VoxLand is a game, which I and my friend made as the final project for University course *Making games in Unity3D game engine*. Here is the version wich we showed our teacher, but the project is still under construction, and we are developing it.
You can see documentation of this version [here](./VoxLand.pdf) *(it's only in polish)*.

## Video

* [voxLand - demo video](https://youtu.be/6g6Be8tLhWk)

## Instalation

* You can find instalation instructions [here](https://github.com/Bitterisland6/Unity/blob/master/README.md) in *Running the project* section.

* Unity version: *2019.2.7f2*

## Instructions

* As it's not whole finished game, but a part of bigger project, here you can fight some zombies and one boss.

* Use `W/S/A/D` to move `forward/backward/left/right`.

* Use `Space` to jump *(when you hold the `Space` longer, you will jump higher)*. There is possible double jump.

* Use `left mouse button` to attack, if you time your second click well, you can make combo with second, more powerfull, attack. You can also make super powerfull atack when you press `left mouse button` while in air.

* Use `shift` to make a dash.

* Use `I` to open and quit inventory. While inventory is open you can drag items outside inventory pannel to drop them, or drag items to humanoid model, to have items on you.***(In this version items don't give you real bonus)***

* Use `Q` to focus on enemy ***(works only if you are close enough to enemy)***.

* Use `mouse` to rotate camera and player.

* Use `E` to collect items.
