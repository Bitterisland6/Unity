## Instalation

* You can find instalation instructions in [here](https://github.com/Bitterisland6/Unity/blob/master/README.md) in *Running the project* section.

* Unity version: *2019.2.7f2*

## Instructions

* Topic of this game jam was ***Don't trust the game***, so I would actually destroy you fun if i told here all the rules and goals. *The only thing you should know now is that you have to escape from maze.*

* For movement I can say that you can look around with `mouse`, jump with `Space` and move with standard keys used for moveming in games

* Tip: **you need to find something (or some things?) and get somwhere**

* Second Tip: ***DON'T TRUST THE GAME***
