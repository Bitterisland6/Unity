# Unity

My games made in Unity game engine (all in c#).

## Getting Started

To get you a copy of my projects you need to have installed **Unity** on your computer.
If you want only the executables, then you can find them in 'projectName/projectName/Build/yourOS'.

### Prerequisites

You can easly download Unity or Unity Hub on your computer from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

### Installing

- To install the Unity Hub on Windows or macOS, visit [Download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

- To install the Unity Hub on Linux visit [Download Unity for Linux](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-hub-v2-0-0-release.677485/?_ga=2.62773420.187063667.1583686914-1236938044.1553758856).

***You don't need to have Unity installed to just play the game.***

## Running the game

When you have downloaded all needed files
- Windows: you just need to double click the `projectName SETUP.exe` file, and follow further instructions of the installer.

- macOS: you just need to double click the `projectName.app` file, and follow further instructions if they appear.

- Linux: First you need to unzip the `projectName.zip` *(`unzip projectName.zip` command in terminal)*. Then you can double click the 'projectName.x86_64' file, or open file location in terminal, and run it with command `./projectName.x86_64`. If there are any problems with running the file, add executable rights to this file using `sudo chmod +x projectName.x86_64` command, and try again running the game.

## Running the project

If you have downloaded whole project, to open it, you need to add it to your Unity Hub.
To do so, you just need to open Unity Hub, then click the white `ADD` button in upper right corner. Then in the dialog window, you need to go to the location, where you have downloaded the project, select it and click `ok` in the bottom right corner of dialog window. Then find the project on the projects list in Unit Hub, and double click the projects name (*for each project there is information about unity version which were used by making this project*). 

## General note

- Some projects have also recorded game Demo as 'projectName.mp4', so you can check it out before downloading.
- Most projects are organised with folders, where folder name specifies what is in this folder:
  - Assets
    - Audio     - audio used in the game
    - Animation - animations made or downloaded, and used in game
    - Materials - physics and normal unity materials
    - Models    - models of game objects
    - preFab    - prefabs 
    - Sprites   - sprites used in game
    - Scenes    - all scenes of the game
    - Scripts   - all scripts used in game (*I try to comment my code very carefully and make it as readable as possible*)
    - *other downloaded assets from asset store*
  - Build
    - Windows - game version for Windows
    - macOS   - game version for macOS
    - Linux   - game version for Linux
